# Tests Atlas Vector Search against a "local Atlas deployment"
# by executing a $search aggregation pipeline.
# This requires a little more effort, because you have to 
# vectorize the search query.

# Run all .js scripts from within the Mongo Shell.
# Within the MongoDB shell, javascripts can be executed as follows:
# load('./<script-name.js>')

# Run the scripts in order to define a query string,
# vectorize the query string using a remote embedding service (subscription & API key required)
# and run an aggregation pipeline containing a `$vectorSearch` stage.
# As provided, these scripts query the `sample_mflix.embedded_movies` collection,
# included with the Atlas sample datasets.
